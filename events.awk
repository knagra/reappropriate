# Process events files.  Create a Python dictionary for each entry.

# To call this script, execute:
# awk -f events.awk ../all_events.txt > events_r.txt

# Set the field separator to the tab character
# This will make the fields:
# $2 := date of event
# $3 := title of event
# $4 := event description
# possibly $(>=5) := extra lines of the body
BEGIN {
    FS = "\t"
}

{
    # Section head

    # Ignore empty lines
    if (match($0, /^$/)) {
        next

    # Replace quotes with escaped quotes

    # For whatever reason, tabs in the fourth entry also represent newlines.
    # So, append all entries after the fourth, separated by newline characters.
